# Personalised-Medicine-project
PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Basically, the problem is all about   personalised treatment regarding personalised treatment for cancer through genetic testing. Genetic map is unique for every individual. Mutations in genes leads to cancer. So our problem in precise is all about classifying clinically actionable mutations that led predefined treatment for cancer. Challenge lies in distinguishing mutilations that contribute to cancer growth. Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. We need  to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.
